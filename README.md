# NestJS Starter 🐱‍💻

A pretty simple starter for [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com/) with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), validation Pipes with [Zod](https://zod.dev/) and Bearer based AuthGuard out of the box.

Made this repo to speed up my NestJS setups, but if it works for you, sure, use it.

- JWT Authentication
- Auth Guard Ready
